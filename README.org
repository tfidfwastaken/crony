#+TITLE: crony

sketchy but quick task scheduling.

currently only useful for mac users. it converts cron syntax to launchd format, because who the heck wants to type raw XML.

soon enough I'll try to make it parse something more than cron (more natural language?) and convert it to more backends (crontab for *nix and whatever smoked cheese windows uses)
